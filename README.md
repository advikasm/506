# Program 2: CUDA SpMV

## Project Overview
This project implements **Sparse Matrix–Vector multiplication (SpMV)** in the **Coordinate (COO)** format.  
Two implementations are compared:
1. A **sequential CPU baseline** (`spmv.c`)  
2. A **CUDA GPU version** (`spmv-cuda.cu`)  

Both versions are benchmarked on real sparse matrices from the SuiteSparse collection.

## COO Format
The COO format stores only the nonzero entries of a sparse matrix using three parallel arrays:
- `rows[i]`: row index of the i-th nonzero  
- `cols[i]`: column index of the i-th nonzero  
- `vals[i]`: value of the i-th nonzero  


## Implementation Details

### CPU (Baseline)
- Loads `.mtx` file and parses into COO arrays  
- Initializes dense vectors `x` (randomized) and `y` (zeroed)  
- Runs warm-up iteration, then dynamically sets number of benchmark iterations  
- Measures runtime, GFLOP/s, and GB/s  

### GPU (CUDA)
- Allocates GPU memory (`cudaMalloc`) for COO arrays and vectors  
- Transfers data to device and zero-initializes output  
- Kernel launch: one CUDA thread per nonzero element  
  ```cuda
  if (i < nnz) atomicAdd(&y[rows[i]], vals[i] * x[cols[i]]);
### CUDA Vs Base Implementation
- Same math, new schedule. We keep the exact arithmetic (y[row] += val * x[col]) but assign one CUDA thread per nonzero. That exposes massive parallelism versus the CPU’s single loop.
- Correctness under concurrency. Because many nonzeros share the same destination row, we use atomicAdd(&y[row], val*x[col]) to prevent lost updates—on CPU, the loop’s serial order avoids races; on GPU, atomics make concurrent accumulations correct.
- Launch configuration. We use a grid of (nnz + 255)/256 blocks with 256 threads each, which balances load and achieves good GPU occupancy.
- Device memory + transfers. We allocate device buffers for rows/cols/vals/x/y, copy rows/cols/vals/x from host to device, zero y on device, and copy results back to host if we want to compare.
- Timing symmetry. We mirror the CPU flow: a warm-up kernel timed with CUDA events, then compute num_iterations from the warm-up, then time the main kernel loop and report ms/iter, GFLOP/s, GB/s.
- The CUDA program (spmv-cuda.cu) adapts the same COO idea but offloads the computation to the GPU.

### Core Modifications
- Memory Allocation:
cudaMalloc used for all COO arrays and vectors.
- Data Movement:
Host–device copies with cudaMemcpy; result fetched back after kernel execution.
- Parallel Kernel:
Execution Setup:
- Threads per block: 256
Blocks: (nnz + 255)/256## Figures

- Atomic Operations:
Needed since multiple threads may update the same row in y.




## Advantages
- Thousands of threads allow nearly all nonzeros to be processed in parallel.
- GPU memory bandwidth (~900 GB/s) far exceeds CPU bandwidth.
- SIMT model makes this fine-grained parallelism practical
